  - Authors _expects_ to create / update / delete / publish / synch content as
    simply as saving a file in a directory _so that_ creating / updating /
    deleting / publishing / synching content locally and on NNotes web platform
    requires a minimum overhead.

*** Definitions



** Init State

   - Authors create / update / delete content then upload it on NNotes so that
     uploaded content version is synched with the local version and published.



** Problem

   - 1 local content copy and 1 distant content copy + updates => out of synch
     contents => manual content version management => too much overhead for
     authors.



** End State

   - Author saves content locally in a dropbox directory.
       - content is synch with NNotes DB
       - => local and distant content copy always in synch, automatically => no
         overhead for authors.
